# Question:
# You are given a bank and a list of customers with their transactions.
# The transactions can be either a deposit (positive value) or a withdrawal(negative value).
# The initial balance in the bank is 0.
# The bank can choose any customer to start serving from the list.
# Once a customer is picked, the bank will continue serving the next customer in the list until
# the bank's balance becomes zero or negative.
# At that point, the bank will close.
# Your task is to determine the maximum number of customers that can be served by the bank.
#
# For example, given the customer_transactions = [-1, 2, 4, -3, 5, -10, 3, 10, 1],
# you need to find the maximum number of customers that can be served by the bank.
#
# The answer in this case is 4 i.e. [ 2, 4, -3, 5]
